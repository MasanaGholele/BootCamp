        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's
            engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we
            can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking
            forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very
            important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>

        <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260
            days from now!).</p>
        <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
        <p>Launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
        <p>A week later, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch
            movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
        <p>"meow."</p>
        <p>It sounds like Gizmo, your cat! She must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
        <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly
            isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or turn around now and go home. What will you
            do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to
            have free pizza at the Space Scouts meeting!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>You decide to risk it. The journey is long, and you give sweet Gizmo half your food, knowing that you may not
            survive the return trip, but the Flying Hippo can carry the robot home without you, and at least the
            important experimental data (and Gizmo, of course) will be safe.</p>
        <p>When you arrive at Mars, you quickly locate the sick robot. But, you also discover something else: a large
            ice chest full of delicious sandwiches! The last repair crew to visit the robot must have left this here!
            You unwrap one of the sandwiches and carefully take a bite. Peanut butter! Your favorite! Gizmo's favorite
            too!</p>
        <p>You pack up the sandwiches and the sick robot and begin the trip home, knowing that there's now more than
            enough food for both you and Gizmo.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>Let someone else get the robot. You turn the Flying Hippo around and head home.</p>
        <p>When you get back to the spaceport, you open the door to exit your spaceship and your boss is standing
            outside.</p>
        <p>You apologize and explain the whole thing to him about how there wouldn't have been enough food.</p>
        <p>He says he'll send someone else and that you'll have </p>
        <p>Oh well, at least you still have Gizmo!</p>
