/*
    JavaScript is a powerful language that’s easy to learn!
    In this chapter, we explain the basics of programming, tell you
    what JavaScript is, and get you started with writing your first
    JavaScript commands.

/*
    Computer programming, also known as coding, is when we write instructions for the 
    computers since they can’t do things on their own
*/

/* 
    When you don’t use quotes, JavaScript doesn’t like that one bit. 
    It returns an error message containing the keyword SyntaxError

    You can add words together with JavaScript! When you run a command that
    adds words together, it’s called concatenation
*/

    "Your name" + " " + "is learning JavaScript!"
    "Masana" + " " + "is learning JavaScript!";

 //Result = 'Masana is learning JavaScript!'

/*
    Having Fun with Math
    Now it’s your turn to try out some math problems on your own!
    Clear out your commands and the return values and errors from
    the previous section and experiment with the console.
    Here are some ideas to get you started:*/


//Multiply together two decimal numbers.
    0.3 * 2.4;

//Run multiple commands in one line (for example, 
    
    1 + 1 * 4 / 8;


//Combine your first name with the last name of your celebrity crush.
// Remember to add a space between the first and last name! 

    "Eva" + " " + "Harry Styles".


//Try to do an impossible math problem, such as dividing a number by zero.

    20 / 0;

//Try multiplying a number by a word (in quotes). 

343 * "hi!"

//The result of this will be NaN, which stands for “not a number.”
