//Giving and Receiving Data

/*
    Programs come in many different sizes and have many
    different purposes. Here are three things all programs have in
    common:

    ✓✓A way to receive information from the user  - input
    ✓✓A way to give information back to the user  - output
    ✓✓A way to store and work with information in between giving
    and receiving

    Creating variables

    var myFirstName;
    var favoriteFood;
    var birthday;
    var timeOfDay;

    Notice how we separate words in variable names by using capital
    letters for every word after the first one. Variable names can’t contain spaces, 
    so programmers have created several other ways to separate words.
     This particular style is called camelCase
*/

/*
    In addition to the rule that variable names must not contain
    spaces, there are several other rules that you must follow:

    ✓✓Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore ( _ ), or a dollar sign ($).

    ✓✓Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.

    ✓✓Variable names are case sensitive.

    ✓✓Certain words may not be used as variable names, because
    they have other meanings within JavaScript. These so‐called
    reserved words are as follows:

    break case class catch
    const continue debugger default
    delete do else export
    extends finally for function
    if import in instanceof
    let new return super
    switch this throw try
    typeof var void while
    with yield

Understanding Data Types

The string data type
The string data type holds text.

The number data type
Another type of data that JavaScript understands is the number
data type. Numbers can be positive or negative, as well as whole
numbers or decimal numbers. Numbers are stored in variables
without using quotation marks.

The Boolean data type
The Boolean data type can store one of two possible values: true
or false.
