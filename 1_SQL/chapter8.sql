1.	We saw that library visits have declined recently in most places.

	of internet-connected computers used by the public) and pitusr (uses of public internet computers per year). 
	Modify the code in Listing 8-13 (visits)to calculate the percent change in the sum of each column over time.

	2.	
	Both library survey tables contain a column called obereg, a two-digit 	Bureau of Economic Analysis Code
	that classifies each library agency according to a region of the United States, such as New England,
	Rocky Mountains, and so on. Just as we calculated the percent change in visits grouped by state, 
	do the same to group percent changes in visits by U.S.region using obereg. 
	Consult the survey documentation to find the meaning of each region code. 
	For a bonus challenge, create a table with the obereg code as the primary key and the region name as text,
	and join it to the summary query to group by the region name rather than the code.
